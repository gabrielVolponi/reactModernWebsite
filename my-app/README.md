# 🚀 React Multi-Page Practice Project

Welcome! This repository was created to help me develop and improve my React skills, focusing on building multi-page applications. Here, I am practicing:

- ⚛️ React fundamentals and component structure
- 🎨 Styling with Tailwind CSS
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices
- ♿ Accessibility best practices

Feel free to explore the code and see how I organize components, pages, and styles!
